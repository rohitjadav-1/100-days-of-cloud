## Introduction

I looked at may day #1 entries on GitHub and I think that there is not a single right way to do this. So I am sharing with you what I have already done in the run up to day 1

In preparation for today, I've already:

- Cloned the 100DaysOfCloud GitHub repository
- Setup VSCode & Git on my laptop
- Joined the Discord server
- Written a short article about why I'm doing this challenge
- Tweeted about my plan for the challenge

## Next Steps

I will check for the learning path which will be required for take the next steps
